Business Problem:
The Departmental Store has collected daily transaction data of products sold. 
To optimize product placement, improve cross-selling strategies, and enhance 
customer shopping experience, the store needs to identify frequent item 
combinations. Association Rule Mining helps uncover patterns in customer 
purchases to drive smarter inventory and marketing decisions.

Business Objective:
Minimize: Missed bundling opportunities and inefficient shelf arrangements by 
identifying frequently co-purchased items  
Maximize: Sales revenue and customer satisfaction through targeted promotions 
and strategic product placement

Business Constraints: Limited transaction volume, variability in customer 
preferences, and resource constraints for implementing dynamic marketing and 
inventory changes across departments.
