Business Problem:
A film distribution company wants to better target audiences based on their 
color preferences, which may influence visual themes and marketing aesthetics 
in movie promotions. With access to viewer data indicating liked colors, the 
company seeks to uncover patterns in color choices. Association Rule Mining 
helps identify frequent combinations of preferred colors to inform targeted 
campaigns, design decisions, and personalized recommendations.

Business Objective:
Minimize: Ineffective visual marketing and missed engagement by identifying 
strong associations between color preferences  
Maximize: Viewer satisfaction, campaign effectiveness, and brand resonance 
through personalized visual themes and targeted outreach

Business Constraints: Small dataset size, subjective nature of color 
preferences, and limited resources for implementing customized visual 
strategies across diverse audience segments.

df = pd.read_csv('C:/5-python_crisp-ml(q)/association_rules_py/myphonedata.csv')

Frequent Itemsets:
     support       itemsets
0  0.545455          (red)
1  0.636364        (white)
2  0.545455         (blue)
3  0.363636   (white, red)
4  0.363636    (red, blue)
5  0.363636  (white, blue)

White (support = 0.64), Red (0.55), and Blue (0.55) are the most 
frequently chosen individual colors in this dataset. Based on their 
popularity, we interpret two key associations:

1.White and Red appear together in 36% of cases, suggesting a strong 
co-selection pattern—possibly reflecting aesthetic or thematic pairing 
preferences.

2.Red and Blue co-occur in 36% of cases, indicating a consistent 
combination trend, potentially useful for designing color palettes 
or bundled offerings.
