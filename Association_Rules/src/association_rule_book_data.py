Business Problem:
Kitabi Duniya, a heritage bookstore in India, has experienced a decline in 
annual growth due to the rise of online book sales and widespread Internet 
access. To regain popularity and increase customer footfall, the store needs 
to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior. Association Rule Mining 
can help identify frequently co-purchased book categories to inform bundling, 
store layout, and promotional strategies.

Business Objective:
Minimize: Missed cross-selling opportunities and unsold inventory by identifying 
frequent itemsets and customer preferences  
Maximize: Customer engagement, footfall, and revenue through targeted promotions 
and personalized recommendations

Business Constraints: Sparse and incomplete transaction data due to manual 
record-keeping, limited digital infrastructure, and constrained marketing 
resources for implementing dynamic bundling or personalized campaigns.
