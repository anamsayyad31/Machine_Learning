Business Problem:
A film distribution company wants to better target audiences based on their 
movie preferences. With access to viewer data indicating likes and dislikes 
across various films, the company seeks to uncover patterns in movie choices. 
Association Rule Mining helps identify frequent combinations of liked movies 
to inform targeted marketing, bundling strategies, and personalized 
recommendations.

Business Objective:
Minimize: Ineffective promotions and missed audience engagement by identifying 
strong associations between viewer preferences  
Maximize: Audience satisfaction, targeted outreach, and revenue through 
personalized movie bundles and recommendation systems

Business Constraints: Limited dataset size, variability in viewer tastes, and 
resource constraints for implementing personalized marketing and distribution 
strategies across platforms.

Gladiator (support = 0.7), Sixth Sense (0.6), and Patriot (0.6) are the most 
frequently watched individual movies in this dataset. Based on their popularity,
we’ll interpret two key associations involving these titles:

1. Gladiator and Sixth Sense are watched together by 50% of users, indicating a
strong co-viewing pattern between action and thriller genres.

2. Patriot and Gladiator appear together in 60% of cases, suggesting a high 
overlap in audience preference for historical and war-themed films.
