Business Problem:  
Airline companies need to segment customers based on their flying and loyalty 
program usage patterns. Proper segmentation helps identify high-value customers, 
disengaged customers, and those with unique behaviors like frequent flyers 
who don’t use credit cards. Without such insights, it becomes difficult to 
design targeted loyalty programs, improve customer satisfaction, and prevent churn.

Business Objective:  
Minimize: Customer churn and disengagement by identifying inactive or 
low-engagement flyers and offering reactivation strategies.  
Maximize: Customer lifetime value and loyalty by focusing on high-value 
customers with tailored elite programs, upgrades, and exclusive offers.

Business Constraints: Limited data coverage, overlapping clusters due to 
customer behavior similarities, and moderate clustering quality as shown by 
metrics.

Cluster 0: Active flyers with low credit card usage
- Average enrollment time and miles earned
- Moderate account balance
- Low credit card miles but high flight activity
- Slightly above-average bonus transactions
Insight: These users fly frequently but don’t use credit card miles much. Likely loyal travelers who prefer direct flight benefits over card-based rewards.

Cluster 1: Moderate users with balanced behavior
- Slightly below-average enrollment time and miles
- Average balance and moderate credit card miles
- Moderate bonus transactions, low flight activity
Insight: These are mid-level users with balanced engagement. Could be targeted with offers to increase flight frequency or card usage.

Cluster 2: High-value, high-engagement customers
- Longest enrollment time and highest balance
- Very high credit card miles, bonus transactions, and flight activity
- Above-average qualified miles
Insight: Top-tier customers with full engagement across all channels. Ideal for elite loyalty programs, upgrades, and retention focus.

Cluster 3: Low-engagement, inactive users
- Short enrollment time and lowest balance
- Very low credit card miles, bonus transactions, and flight activity
Insight: These are inactive or disengaged users. May need reactivation campaigns or basic incentives to re-engage.

'''
your score(1844.7850):

very strong clustering struct.

great grouping with strong separation.

Benefits/Impact of the Solution:  
1. Identifies loyal frequent flyers who rely more on direct benefits than card-based rewards, enabling targeted non-card offers.  
2. Helps design campaigns for mid-level users to increase either flight activity or credit card engagement.  
3. Enables strong retention and personalized strategies for top-tier customers with high engagement across all channels.  
4. Highlights disengaged users for reactivation campaigns and basic incentive programs.  
5. Improves allocation of marketing resources by segmenting based on actual usage behavior rather than generic customer profiles.  
6. Provides measurable clustering structure with a high Calinski-Harabasz score (1844.7850), though moderate silhouette score (0.2597) and Davies-Bouldin score (1.1918) indicate overlapping clusters.  
7. Supports continuous improvement by experimenting with linkage methods and optimal cluster numbers to refine customer groups.
